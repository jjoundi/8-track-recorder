# Contributing

Thanks for your interest!

- Use GitHub Issues for bugs/feature requests.
- Use conventional commits if you can (feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:).
- Keep PRs focused and small when possible.
- Dev: `npm i && npm run dev` (HTTPS required for mic).

## Project conventions
- React function components
- Plain Web Audio API (no heavy DSP libs yet)
- Keep UI accessible (labels, focus states)
